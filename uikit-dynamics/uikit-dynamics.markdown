##### UIPushBehavior
##### UISnapBehavior
##### Composite
#### Animators - UIDynamicAnimator
##### init with Reference View
##### init with Collection View
##### init
### Add each piece as you go along to demonstrate
## Real World Application - Add dynamics to a non-game app
### Determine what could make an app more friendly
### Pulsate a button when tapped on / off (favorite star?)
### UICollectionView dynamics - adding dynamic behavior to give physical feel to items when dragging things to change sort order
### Debugging tricks
## Conclusion
## Challenge
