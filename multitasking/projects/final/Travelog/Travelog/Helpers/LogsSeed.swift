Apple engineer Dave Abrahams asks us to put aside our regular ways of developing and follow along as he tells a story using protocol-oriented development rather than classes. After listing off the benefits of classes, he counters those benefits with the revelation that Swift is a protocol-based language. By trading dynamic polymorphism for static polymorphism, he contends that protocols and the new protocol extensions are much better than superclasses for abstraction. Protocols add new magic and lead into the use of value types as outlined in Building Better Apps With Value Types in Swift."
