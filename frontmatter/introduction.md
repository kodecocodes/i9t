# Introduction

TODO

Get ready for your own private tour through the amazing new features of iOS 9. By the time you're done, your iOS knowledge will be completely up-to-date and you'll be able to benefit from the amazing new opportunities in iOS 9.

Sit back, relax and prepare for some high quality tutorials!


## What you need

To follow along with the tutorials in this book, you'll need the following:
- __A Mac running OS X Yosemite or later.__ You'll need this to be able to install the latest version of Xcode.
- __Xcode 7.0 or later.__ Xcode is the main development tool for iOS. You'll need Xcode 7.0 or later for all tasks in this book as Xcode 7.0 is the first version of Xcode to supports iOS 9 and Swift 2.0. You can download the latest version of Xcode for free on the Mac app store here: <https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12>
- __One or more devices (iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch) running iOS 9 or later.__ Most of the chapters in the book let you run your code on the iOS 9 Simulator that comes with Xcode. However, a few chapters later in the book require one or more physical iOS devices for testing.
  
Once you have these items in place, you'll be able to follow along with every chapter in this book. 


## Who this book is for

This book is for intermediate or advanced iOS developers who already know the basics of iOS and Swift development but want to upgrade their iOS 9 skills. 

- __If you are a complete beginner to iOS development__, we recommend you read through _The iOS Apprentice, 4th Edition_ first. Otherwise this book may be a bit too advanced for you.
- __If you are a beginner to Swift__, we recommend you read through either _The iOS Apprentice, 4th Edition_ (if you are a complete beginner to programming), or _The Swift Apprentice_ (if you already have some programming experience) first.

If you need one of these prerequisite books, you can find them on our store here:

<http://www.raywenderlich.com/store>

As with raywenderlich.com, all the tutorials in this book are in Swift.


## How to use this book

This book can be read from cover to cover, but we don't recommend using it this way unless you have a lot of time and are the type of person who just "needs to know everything". (It's okay; a lot of our tutorial team is like that, too!)

Instead, we suggest a pragmatic approach — pick and choose the chapters that interest you the most, or the chapters you need immediately for your current projects. Most chapters are self-contained, so you can go through the book in a non-sequential order.

Looking for some recommendations of important chapters to start with? Here's our suggested Core Reading List: 

-

That covers the "Big 7" topics of iOS 9; from there you can dig into other topics of particular interest to you. 


## Book overview

iOS 9 has a selection of new technologies and APIs that cover the entire OS. Here's what you'll learn about in this book:

1. __Chapter 1, Swift 2.0:__ Swift is only a year old, but a lot has changed since it was born. Discover the new error handling model, protocol extensions, new control flow features and much more! You'll be ready to tackle the rest of the book, and to upgrade your existing code to Swift 2.0!
2. __Chapter 2, Introducing App Search:__ With iOS 9, users can search inside your apps using the system Spotlight utility. Learn how to adopt this new functionality, and make the content inside your apps more discoverable.
3. __Chapter 3, Your App on the Web:__ Deep linking will allow you to direct users browsing your website directly to the correct point inside your iOS app. Find out how to integrate this functionality in your own site and app as you follow along with updating the RWDevCon website and app!
4. __Chapter 4, App Thinning:__ App Thinning describes a collection of new App Store technologies that ensure that users downloading your app only download exactly what their specific device requires. Discover what you need to do to adopt App Thinning, together with how you can split your app's resources up into chunks that are only downloaded from the App Store when they are required.
5. __Chapter 5, Multitasking:__ Completely new to iOS 9 is the ability to run two apps side-by-side on iPads. Get up to speed on what you need to do to ensure your apps are ready for multitasking.
6. __Chapter 6, UIStackView & Auto Layout Changes:__ Stack views will change the way you build your interfaces. They remove a lot of the boilerplate Auto Layout and make it really easy to construct simple layouts. Learn the basics of stack views and many of the other new Auto Layout features.
7. __Chapter 7, Intermediate UIStackView:__ Dive deeper into stack views — covering nesting, animation and working with them in code.
8. __Chapter 8, What's New in Storyboards?:__ Ever faced the problem of unmanageably large storyboards? Discover how to refactor your huge storyboard into smaller segments with new storyboard references.
9. __Chapter 9, Custom Segues:__ Creating custom view controller transitions has never been an easy task, but iOS 9 chips away at some of the complexity. Learn how to create your own custom segues to make custom transitions between view controllers far easier to understand.
10. __Chapter 10, UIKit Dynamics:__ iOS 9 includes loads of great improvements to UIKit Dynamics — making it really easy to model complex physics animations within your apps. Learn all about the new behaviors and debugging improvements as you build a real-world example.
11. __Chapter 11, Contacts:__ Accessing the on-device contacts has been challenging in the past — with a C-level API. iOS 9 introduces two new frameworks to ease interaction with the contacts. Discover how to integrate with the device address book in a much simpler manner.
12. __Chapter 12, Testing:__ Xcode 7 now includes a fully-featured solution for creating UI tests for your application. Discover how to add UI tests to your own apps, and review some of the other improvements to testing.
13. __Chapter 13, Location & Mapping:__ It's finally possible to choose your favorite color for a map pin! Learn about this, transit directions, Core Location enhancements and more!
14. __Chapter 14, What's New in Xcode?:__ There's loads of cool new stuff in iOS 9, but don't forget about your friendly IDE! Learn how the improved gauges make optimizing your app really easy, along with many other new features.
