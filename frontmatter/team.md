# About the Team

### Aaron Douglas

![width=30%](images/aaron_douglas.jpg)

Aaron was that kid taking apart the mechanical and electrical appliances at five years of age to see how they worked. He never grew out of that core interest - to know how things work. He took an early interest in computer programming, figuring out how to get past security to be able to play games on his dad's computer. He's still that feisty nerd, but at least now he gets paid to do it. 

Aaron works for Automattic (WordPress.com, Akismet, SimpleNote) as a Mobile Maker primarily on the WordPress for iOS app.
