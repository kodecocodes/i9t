					<p>Learn how teamwork lets you dream bigger, through the story of an indie iPhone developer who almost missed out on the greatest opportunity of his life.</p>

					<p>Every single iOS developer has used knowledge, software, and tools contributed by different people. Our community is part of what makes creating software a wonderful experience and it is important to its continuation. In this talk, find out how each and every one of you can give back to the community through open source, spoken or written word, and humility.</p>

						</div>
					</a>
					<p>Even the slightest mention of the word "Mathematics" makes many of us break out in hives. But mathematics is also what makes exciting new technologies possible: big data, machine intelligence, computer vision, robotics. Fortunately, the idea that math is hard and scary is a myth. In this talk, I will try to convince you that if you are able to learn programming, you're also able to learn math - and enjoy it!</p>

							<span class="speaker">Vicki Wenderlich</span>
							<span class="mins">17:36</span>
							<span class="label">2015</span>
						</div>
					</a>
					<p>We all have a concept of our own identity: as a developer, an artist, etc. But when our internal identity doesn't match our external actions, we feel a lot of stress and negative feelings. In this talk, join Vicki in exploring how these identity conflicts affect our moods, through Vicki's childhood growing up as an identical twin, to an adult with constantly shifting career paths.</p>

							<span class="speaker">Alexis Gallagher</span>
							<span class="mins">18:52</span>
							<span class="label">2015</span>
						</div>
					</a>
					<p>Are you really the developer you want to be? Or an impostor, pretending to be that? Has software, perhaps, destroyed you? This talk will tiptoe up to these questions, by reflecting on hero worship, Clojure's model of time, tele transporters, and personal identity in a shifting world.</p>

					<p>I often get asked at iOS conferences and meetups, "What's it like to write for raywenderlich.com?", "Have you ever met Ray - what's he like?", or "How did the team grow over the years?" If you're curious about the answers to these and more - this session is for you! Take a break from the intensive tutorials in the conference, and enjoy some amusing inside stories about the team and Ray himself.</p>

							<span class="label">2015</span>
						</div>
					</a>
					<p>In the world of deadlines and ongoing pressure, we often lose sight of what we set out to achieve. Writing software leaves immense opportunity to sweep things under the rug. It's time to stop cheating ourselves and society. Every one of us is building the future of this world; let's make it great through craftsmanship.</p>

					<p>We are all different and we perceive/think in many different ways. And yet there are many universal patterns when it comes to use our cognition. In this talk, learn how to exploit these universal patterns to create well designed applications.</p>

							<span class="label">2015</span>
						</div>

					<p>Choosing to change your life or career significantly can be terrifying. Ellen Shapiro has done it twice, and learned a ton. Learn how to determine when it's time to choose a new path, and how to reframe your fears into strengths to build the courage to make a change.</p>

							<span class="mins">14:11</span>
							<span class="label">2015</span>
						</div>
					</a>
					<p>Sometimes we don't recognize opportunities when they're offered to us, and end up missing out. When you reach for opportunities, you'll do more interesting projects, work with people you admire, and experience personal growth that can surprise you. The goal of this talk is to encourage you to take opportunities that stretch you, so you can become a better programmer and professional.</p>

							<span class="label">2015</span>
						</div>

					<p>Starting a project is easy - finishing one is hard. This talk will introduce you to some simple project management tools that might help you overcome some common pitfalls when working on your projects and hopefully get your projects finished and on the App Store.</p>

					<p>NSBrief has grown over the years to be one of the most well respected iOS & Mac Developer podcasts available on the inter webs. With a wide range of topics and guests, NSBrief has been a project that has opened doors I'd never imagined. Let's take a walk down memory lane, see lessons learned, and also look forward to see what's ahead for one of the older Cocoa podcasts out there.</p>
