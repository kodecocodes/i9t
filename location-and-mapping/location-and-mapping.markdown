## Chapter 12: Location and Mapping
Apple continues to improve it's Map and Location's framework every year. Developers that incorporate MapKit into their apps should be really excited about what's new!

The engineers at Apple have been working really hard to provide us with better tools, to create great user experiences for apps that use maps.

Besides getting walking, and driving directions to your destination. Maps now also provides Transit, showing you the various metro stops to your location. Also Apple has release their flyover API, and you will now be able to show flyovers within your application. Along with all of these Map API enhancements, MapKit is now further customizable than before.

Lastly, going hand in hand with MapKit is Core Locations. Apple has made this location framework much easier to use. They designed this API with the users as a focus. Being mindful of the user's device battery life, and improvements to background location fetching.

In this chapter you will be exposed to the following:

* Customize MapKit's appearance.
* Use the new Transit API.
* Provide users with time predictions such as when you leave and when they will get there.
* Request the user's location in a straightforward way

If you know nothing about MapKit, this chapter is a great way to learn about what's new with iOS 9!
