# Chapter 2: Introducing App Search

One frustration for many iOS developers is that Apple gets to have all of the fun. They're the ones who get deep integrations with iOS that every developer yearns for. The good news is that after Apple has vetted out a feature for themselves they often bring it to the masses; like with App Extensions in iOS 8.

Currently, when a user wants to get to content in your app they have to go through a series of steps. They flip through pages on their home screen to find your app, open it, and search what they're looking for. A savvy user may launch your app by using Siri or searching for it in Spotlight, but still they are left searching for their content once the app is launched. Meanwhile, Apple gets to make things like contacts, notes, messages, email, apps and other things directly searchable within Spotlight. The user simply taps on the search result and are taken straight to the contentâ€”no fair!

New with iOS 9 Apple brings the ability for third party developers to make *their* content searchable through Spotlight! This also means that users can search within your app using Siri! Not only do you get to make your content searchable with Siri, you also get to make Siri more aware of your content. By saying "Remind me about *this* when I get home." a user can create a reminder that links to the record they are viewing in *your* app! When the reminder pops up, they can go directly back to what they were doing. Now you don't need to leave 20 tabs open in Safari in hopes that you get back to them later. Create a reminder, close the tab, and get on with your life! [TODO: Fact check this with GM on a device]

## Trifecta of App Search

Before diving into a sample project and code you first need to be aware that there are three aspects of App Search. Each are broken into separate APIs that achieve distinct results, but also work in concert with each other.

### NSUserActivity

The first aspect is `NSUserActivity`. Apple has taken a clever yet brilliant approach to App Search by tying it into `NSUserActivity` that used to enable Handoff in iOS 8.

If you are not aware, Handoff allows a user to continue an activity on another device. As an example, consider that you're reading an email on your phone when you sit down at your Mac. A special Mail icon on your Mac's Dock appears that allows you to launch Mail and resume reading the message. This is powered by `NSUserActivity` who provides the OS with information necessary to resume the task on another device. The communication between devices occurs over a combination of iCloud, Bluetooth and WiFi.

The `NSUserActivity` class was given a few new properties to enable App Search that you will learn about in this chapter. Apple has determined through usage metrics that users want to get back to content they've previously viewed. If a task can be represented as an `NSUserActivity` to be handed off, it might make sense for that task to be searchable and continued on the *same* device. This chapter will not cover Handoff specifically, but you will learn how to make content searchable once it has been viewed.

### CoreSpotlight

The second aspect is Core Spotlight, while it is nice to allow users to search for content they've previously accessed, it may make sense for your app to make *all* content searchable. CoreSpotlight is what the stock iOS apps like Mail and Notes use to index their content. Through this API you are given fine grained control of what, when and how content is indexed. You can also update and remove items from the search index. CoreSpotlight is the best way to provide full search capabilities of your app's content, including content that is private to the user. In this chapter you will be learning how to use the new CoreSpotlight APIs to index all of the content of an app.

### Web Markup

The third aspect is Web Markup which is tailored towards apps that mirror their public content from a web site. A good example of this would be Amazon where you can search of any of the products that they sell, or even RayWenderlich.com. This chapter will not touch on Web Markup, but will find that information in Chapter 3, "Your App On The Web".

## Sample Project

For this chapter you will be working with a sample app that simulates what a company address book might look like. Rather than every employee being added to your phones address book, the app provides a directory of your colleagues. To keep things simple, the app runs off of set of data that resides in the app bundle as a folder of avatar images and a JSON file containing all of the employee information. In the real-world you would prefer to have a networking component that downloads a bundle of data like this or one that accesses a true web-service.

### New Employee Orientation

Start by opening the Starter Project, but before diving into any code, build and run.

![iphone](/images/app-screen-1.png)

You will immediately see a list of all employees in the company, it's a small company of around 25 individuals. Select **Brent Reid** from the list.

![iphone](/images/app-screen-2.png)

This view shows all of the employee's details and also a related list of employees who are in the same department. That is the extent of the app, very simple. What might make this app infinitely better is searching, as it stands you can't even search while you're in the app. You won't be adding search in the app, but you will be adding the ability to search from Spotlight!

#### Code Walk

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the codebase of the project. There are two targets, Colleagues which is the app itself, and EmployeeKit which is a framework to help you in interacting with the employee database. Open **Employee.swift**, this is the model for an employee, it has all of the properties you might expect having just viewed Brent Reid's record. Employee instances are initialized using a JSON model.

Moving on, open **EmployeeService.swift**. At the top of the file you will notice an extension declaration. You will be filling out the implementation of those two methods marked with "TODO" comments later. More importantly for now, this service provides two public APIs, `employeeWithObjectId(` and `fetchEmployees()`. Both methods are commented, the first provides an Employee given its `objectId` and the second results all employee records from the database.

The rest of the code in the EmployeeKit target is unimportant to the chapter's topic so there's no need to be familiar with them to continue. Jump to the Colleagues folder which contains the code for the app itself.

Open **AppDelegate.swift**, notice that there is only one method in here `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)`. The implementation switches on `Setting.searchIndexingPreference` which is in place to allow the user to change the behavior of search indexing. Notice that depending on the setting's value, a different service method is called. If you recall, these are the service methods that had "TODO" comments for you to implement later. No need to worry about that just yet, but you should be aware of this setting. The setting can be changed in the Settings iOS App under "Colleagues".

That wraps up what you should be aware of for now, the rest of the code is view controller logic which you will be modifying, but it's unnecessary to fully comprehend what is going on there in order to achieve the goal of enabling App Search.

## Search Previously Viewed Records

As mentioned, `NSUserActivity` is the first step one should make towards implementing App Search. There are a number of reasons for this.

1. It's dead simple; creating an `NSUserActivity` instance can be done by setting a few properties.
1. As a user navigates content that mark `NSUserActivity` instances as the current activity, iOS will rank that content. Content that is accessed frequently is considered to be more important to the user and search results will reflect that.
1. You get the benefit of providing context to Siri.
1. You're one step closer to providing Handoff support.

Dead simple to implement, you say? Prove it.

Add a new Swift file named **EmployeeExt.swift** under the EmployeeKit group and verify that the target is set to **EmployeeKit**.

Define an extension on `Employee` with a static String named `domainIdentifier`.

```swift
extension Employee {
  public static let domainIdentifier = "com.raywenderlich.colleagues.employee"
}
```

This string will be used to identify the type of `NSUserActivity` created for Employees. Next, add a computed property named `userActivityUserInfo`.

```swift
public var userActivityUserInfo: [NSObject: AnyObject] {
  return ["id": objectId]
}
```

This is a dictionary that will be used as an attribute for your `NSUserActivity` that you will add now.

```swift
public var userActivity: NSUserActivity {
  let activity = NSUserActivity(activityType: Employee.domainIdentifier)
  activity.title = name
  activity.userInfo = userActivityUserInfo
  activity.keywords = [email, department]
  return activity
}
```

This property will later be used to conveniently obtain an `NSUserActivity` instance for an Employee. There are a few `NSUserActivity` properties being used:
- `title`: The name of the activity, it will also appear as the primary name in a search result
- `userInfo`: A dictionary of values for you to use when the activity is passed back to you, this will be used later to open the app to a specific employee record.
- `keywords`: A set of localized keywords that help the user find the record when searching.

Now your `NSUserActivity` property you can be used when an employee record is being viewed to make the record searchable. Open **EmployeeViewController.swift** and add the following at the bottom of the `viewDidLoad()` method.

```swift
let activity = employee.userActivity
if case .Disabled = Setting.searchIndexingPreference {
  activity.eligibleForSearch = false
} else {
  activity.eligibleForSearch = true
}

userActivity = activity
```

In this code you are retrieving the `userActivity` property that you just created on `Employee` via an `extension`. You then check the app setting, if searching is disabled, mark the activity as not eligible for search, otherwise mark it true. Finally, set the view controller's `userActivity` property to your value.

> **NOTE**: The `userActivity` property on the view controller is inherited from `UIResponder`, in iOS 8 Apple added this property for Handoff suport.

The last step to get searching working at a basic level is to override `updateUserActivityState()`

```swift
override func updateUserActivityState(activity: NSUserActivity) {
  activity.addUserInfoEntriesFromDictionary(employee.userActivityUserInfo)
}
```

The system will call this method at various times in the lifecycle of your `UIResponder` and you are responsible for keeping the activity up to date, in this case you simply provide the same information when it is called as there is no varying state for the employee record.

Great! Now when an employee is viewed, that history will be tracked and become searchable (provided that setting is turned on). So go ahead and turn on the setting so that **Viewed Records** are indexed. You will find the setting in the Settings app under **Colleagues**.

![iphone](/images/app-screen-3.png)

Now, build and run the app, and then select **Brent Reid**. At this point you won't see anything happen, but behind the scenes the activity was indexed. Now, go to the Home screen (if you're using the Simulator you can type **CMD+H**). Bring up Spotlight by either swiping down from the middle of the screen or swiping all the way to the left of your home screen pages. Type "brent" into the search field.

And there's Brent Reid as a result!
